Hanhui Wang (王翰辉) is an incoming Ph.D. student at the Visual Intelligence Group at **Northeastern University** (NEU), where he will be advised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/). His previous research has centered on *3D Computer Vision*, *Multimodal Learning*, and *Generative AI*, with a particular focus on spatial reasoning, 3D scene understanding, and the safety of generative models. Prior to joining NEU, he received his bachelor's degree from **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** (HUST) and his master's degree from the **University of Southern California** (USC). He has had the honor of collaborating with [Prof. Xianzhi Li](https://nini-lxz.github.io/), [Prof. Zhengzhong Tu](https://vztu.github.io/), and [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) on a range of research topics spanning diverse areas of computer vision. He also gained valuable industry experience through internships at leading technology companies such as [iFLYTEK](https://www.iflytek.com/en/).

**Research Keywords**: Machine Unlearning, Aritificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, 3D Vision, Multimodality, Generative AI.


<!-- :heavy_check_mark: **Theme 1: Trustworthy Foundation Models: Robustness, Fairness, and Unlearning**: Yihua explores how to enhance the trustworthiness of foundation models, focusing on robustness against adversarial attacks, fairness in decision-making, and the emerging area of machine unlearning to ensure data privacy and compliance with deletion requests.

:heavy_check_mark: **Theme 2: Scalable Foundation Models: Efficient Models, Data, and Algorithms**: In this theme, Yihua's work revolves around designing models that are not only powerful but also computationally efficient. His research includes advancements in model sparsification, memory-efficient fine-tuning techniques, and optimizing data usage for large-scale models.

:heavy_check_mark: **Theme 3: Optimization in Modern ML: Bi-Level and Zeroth-Order Optimization**
This research line focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of scalable machine learning algorithms, addressing real-world constraints through bi-level optimization and zeroth-order optimization.

**Collaboration Opportunities**

I am always open to collaborations with researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students seeking Ph.D. positions. While my primary research focuses on trustworthy and scalable ML algorithms for LLMs and DMs, I am also interested in exploring a wide range of topics beyond these areas. If you have exciting research ideas or are looking for opportunities to conduct research under professional guidance, feel free to reach out to me.
